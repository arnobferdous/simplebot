These commands control the channel topic using a set of named "columns" and a divider.  It is based on an original design by TMFKsoft and also used in the popular Techie-Bot.  It produces topics like the following: "Minecraft Chat | Eric is Online | http://mysever.com".  That is made of up 5 different columns, a topic (Minecraft Chat), an owner (Eric), a verb (is), a status (Online), and a static string (http://myserver.com).  You can set each column separately without affecting the others:
-
!topic Minecraft Chat
!towner Eric
!tverb is
!tstatus Away
!tstatic http://mywebsite.com
