-
These commands allow you to attach a Google Calendar to the current #channel, so you can emit the current and next events anytime you want.  To find your Calendar ID, open your calendar in Google, make sure it is public, edit settings, then grab the ID in the "Calendar Address" section which should look like this: "(Calendar ID: iu9de9ell3bhagnk1con4052q0@group.calendar.google.com)".
The CALENDAR command can be abbreviated to just "CAL" if you want, i.e. "!cal refresh".
